Notes:
-A program that is based on the topics I've learned in my Physics class. 
-Not complete yet, will add more course topics on another time.


Bugs:
-Having a lot of trouble getting the output printed after calculation.
-After declaring variables program does the calculations but looks back to menu screen instead of printing results to console. 
-Any insight or help on the matter would be great, thank you!
